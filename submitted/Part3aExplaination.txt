mprotect() is used to change the permission of calling process' memory. In the program BufferRedirect64.c we are giving execute, read and write permission to the process' memory. Therefore even if the program is not compiled with -z execstack option it is able to execute the shellcode in the memory. Whereas without mprotect(), we have to compile the program with execstack compile time option to make the shellcode in memory run, otherwise it gives Segmentation fault.
